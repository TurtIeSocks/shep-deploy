# Deploy dog design

Brainstormed with Rin, 2026-08-26, the evening shep 0.1.0 published.

## Goal

A dog that redeploys a sheep when a watched git branch gets a new commit:
fetch, build in an isolated release directory, swap to it, reload, verify
against the sheep's own readiness probe, and roll back on its own if the new
release does not come up.

Rin's framing was "a mini Vercel", explicitly not a Vercel replacement. Her
stated evidence is the strongest argument for building it at all: "Do you know
how many janky updating/deploying scripts I've written over the years?" Anyone
running a flock has written the pull-build-restart script, and written it
slightly differently each time.

## Where this lives

The dog is its own repository and its own crate, not part of shep:
[github.com/TurtIeSocks/shep-deploy](https://github.com/TurtIeSocks/shep-deploy),
scaffolded 2026-08-26. It publishes to crates.io the way `shep-log-rotate`
does, and it consumes `shep-core` and `shep-client` as an ordinary dependent.

**Adopted, it is named `deploy`.** Prerequisite 2 below strips a leading
`shep-` from the default name, the way cargo strips `cargo-`, so
`cargo install shep-deploy` followed by `shep adopt` gives a dog called
`deploy`. With prerequisite 3, that makes the operator's command read as plain
English:

```
shep deploy koji
```

Rin's observation, and worth recording because it is why the three
prerequisites are prerequisites rather than nice-to-haves: the ergonomics only
land if all three do.

The name "Fred" appears throughout the brainstorming conversation as a
placeholder and is not the product name.

## Why this exists as a design rather than a feature request

Two things make it more than a wrapper around `git pull && npm run build`.

**It can verify.** shep already runs readiness probes and already reloads
blue/green. A shell script cannot tell whether the app it just restarted is
actually serving; shep can, and it already does. Auto-rollback gated on the
probe is the thing every hand-rolled script skips because it is hard.

**It can be shipped by upstream.** ReactMap and Koji have self-hosting users
who each perform the same fiddly setup slightly differently. If the repo
carries its own app definition, "how do I run this" stops being a README
section people misread and becomes a file. That was Rin's argument and it is
better than the convenience one.

## Non-goals

Named explicitly, because "mini Vercel" invites scope creep:

- **Preview deploys per branch.** Dynamic routing plus N live environments is
  the single largest piece of Vercel and none of it is needed here.
- **Build caching as a service**, multi-tenancy, a web UI.
- **Multi-host anything.** shep-v1.md §1 already cuts it and nothing here
  revisits that.
- **Containers.** Also a documented v1 non-goal, and unchanged.
- **Static-site targets.** Long-running processes only. A static site has no
  process to restart and wants a different design; revisit separately if ever.

Note that [shep-v1.md](https://github.com/TurtIeSocks/shep/blob/main/docs/specs/shep-v1.md) §1 lists "deployment tooling"
as a v1 non-goal, meaning `pm2 deploy`: host lists, revision directories, `ref`
and `repo` per environment, remote execution over SSH. This design is much
smaller and lives outside the shep binary. Reconsidering the cut is not
reversing it.

## Where the line sits

**shep owns processes. The dog puts files on disk and tells shep what to run.**

shep learns nothing new about git, builds, releases, symlinks or branches. The
dog drives shep exclusively over the socket that already exists:

| direction | what crosses | exists today |
|---|---|---|
| dog → shep | `Start { apps: Vec<AppConfig> }` to register a bootstrapped app | yes; daemon re-normalises because peer input is untrusted |
| dog → shep | `Reload` after a swap, `Restart` as fallback | yes |
| dog → shep | `Describe` / `Subscribe` to watch for `Online` | yes |
| shep → dog | `DogConfig` for the dog's own config section | yes |

The one shep-side addition this design asks for is smits, below. Everything
else is a `shep-core` + `shep-client` consumer, which makes this the
validating use case for the dog contract rather than an exception carved out
of it.

## Smits

Rin's requirement, stated as non-negotiable: `shep flock` must show which sheep
are being watched. Making the whole feature internal would buy that, at the
price of shep's core learning what a deployment is.

Instead, a general mechanism: **a dog may attach a short string to a sheep, and
`shep flock` renders it without understanding it.** The dog sets
`▲ main@a1b2c3`;
shep stores a string and paints a column. Reusable by any dog.

Precedent for the shape: `ProcessInfo::last_exit` plus an EXIT column landed
2026-08-19 as a wire change. This is the same move.

**Smits are ephemeral and owned by the dog that published them.** Held in
memory by the daemon, never persisted. When a dog stops for any reason, whether
disabled, rehomed, crashed or lost to a daemon restart, its smits go with it,
and it republishes on its next poll.

This is a lifecycle decision rather than an implementation detail. The
alternative, persisting them, means a rehomed dog leaves `shep flock` showing
`▲ main@a1b2c3` forever, attributed to a dog that no longer exists. Making
smits ephemeral removes that whole class of orphan instead of adding cleanup
logic to every path that can stop a dog.

**Naming.** `smit` is the real shepherding term for a paint mark identifying
which flock a sheep belongs to, and unlike a brand it is deliberately
temporary, which is exactly what this is. `badge` is the plain alias, per the
lexicon's established pairing (`bleats`/`logs`, `stock`/`scale`,
`whisper`/`sendline`). `brand` was considered and rejected as permanent-by
-metaphor; `badge` alone was rejected as primary because the README already
carries seven shields.io badges and one word should not mean two things in one
project. Rin approved `smit` on the precedent of `muster` and `thatlldo`.

## Layout

Everything the dog owns lives under `$SHEP_HOME`, keyed by **sheep name**, not
by repository. Rin runs `bpm`, `ctm` and `opm` as three deployments of one
ReactMap repo, so repository is the wrong key.

```
$SHEP_HOME/deploy/<sheep>/
├── git/                      one clone; object store shared by every worktree
├── releases/<sha>/           a git worktree per release
└── current -> releases/<sha>
```

There is deliberately **no `shared/` directory**. The user's own checkout plays
that role: they followed the project's normal setup instructions, so their
config files already sit exactly where the app expects them, and the symlinks
point back there. An earlier draft had a `shared/` tree plus a `shared = [...]`
array in the Flockfile; Rin rejected both, correctly, as machinery for
something the user has already done by hand.

**The cost, recorded because it is real:** the user's checkout becomes
load-bearing forever. Deleting or moving it leaves every release with dangling
symlinks, and a `git clean -xdf` in it removes the config every release depends
on. That is a comprehensible failure with an obvious cause, which is why it is
acceptable, but it should be documented for operators rather than discovered.

The sheep's `cwd` is `<root>/current`, permanently. Swapping a release is
`rename(2)` on a symlink, which is atomic, so there is no instant where
`current` points at nothing.

**The deploy tree outlives the dog and is not its scratch space.** It sits
under `$SHEP_HOME`, which looks like the dog's territory, but it is where the
apps actually live: every running sheep's `cwd` points into it. Forgetting the
dog must never remove it, and an operator tidying up `$SHEP_HOME/deploy/` after
rehoming would take down running apps. Document this for operators rather than
letting them find it.

**Why `$SHEP_HOME` rather than the user's own directory.** The user's existing
checkout is never restructured, moved, or written to. One uniform layout per
app, ownership and permissions already settled by whoever owns `$SHEP_HOME`,
and trivially backed up. An earlier draft put releases beside the user's clone
and required a migration; that was worse and is dropped.

## Configuration

Three files, and it matters which of them upstream controls.

**`Flockfile.toml`, committed in the repo.** Upstream owns it. The app
definition: name, script, probe, instances, and a build block. This is the file
that makes the feature worth building, because upstream shipping it is what
saves every self-hoster the same fiddly setup.

**`Flockfile.override.toml`, gitignored, in the repo.** The user owns it. Deep
merged over the committed file, override wins. Because it is gitignored, the
sharing mechanism below carries it into every release automatically, with no
special case.

**`[dog.<name>]` in `shep.toml`.** Dog-level settings only: poll interval, how
many releases to keep. Deliberately nothing per-target, for the reason below.

**`deploy.toml`, in the deploy tree, written by the dog.** Per-target state
lives beside the thing it describes, not in the dog's config section:

```
$SHEP_HOME/deploy/bpm/deploy.toml
```

It records the remote and branch, the last deployed sha, the verify mode,
whether the target is watched, and the sheep's `cwd` and `script` **as they
were before the dog took over**.

**`watch` is an enum, `auto` or `manual`, defaulting to `auto`.** A `manual`
target is skipped by the poll loop entirely and deploys only when asked:

```
shep deploy koji
```

Everything else still applies to it. Releases, shared linking, the atomic
swap, probe verification, auto-rollback and retention all work identically;
the only thing that changes is that nothing happens until somebody says so.

Rin asked for this and it was missing. Two cases it serves. Somebody who wants
the convenience without a deploy on every commit, which is the case she named.
And pausing a target during an incident without rehoming the dog, which is the
same switch and matters more when something is already going wrong.

**The mode is set by flag, never by hand.** `deploy.toml` is the dog's file
and an operator should not be editing it:

```
shep deploy koji --watch manual
```

**That form does NOT deploy.** It sets the mode, prints what changed, and
exits. The temptation is to have it deploy as well, since the verb says
deploy, and that would break the case above: pausing a target during an
incident is exactly when a deploy must not fire. systemd split the same
problem into `enable` and `start` for the same reason, adding `--now` as the
opt-in for both. Two commands are the answer here if somebody wants both, and
a `--now` flag can be added later if that proves annoying rather than
theoretical.

**The smit differs by mode**, so `shep flock` answers "which of these is
actually being watched" without a second command:

```
▲ main@a1b2c3      watched
⏸ main@a1b2c3      manual
```

**Deliberately not added: a `--branch` flag.** The branch comes from the
user's own checkout, so `git checkout stable` retargets the deploy and nobody
learns a new config key. That was the best idea in this design and a flag
would give the same fact two sources of truth. Somebody wanting a different
branch checks one out.

**Deferred, not rejected: `--commit <sha>`.** Deploying a named commit asks a
question this design has no clean answer for, which is whether the target is
now pinned there or whether the next poll moves it off. Worth answering
deliberately later rather than guessing now.

Rin found the reason this matters by asking what happens when somebody rehomes
the dog. Keying per-target state to the dog's *name* means renaming or
re-adopting the dog destroys the record of every deployment it manages, and
those are unrelated things. In the tree, the state survives rehoming, survives
re-adoption under a different name, and makes each tree self-describing enough
that a different deploy dog could pick it up.

### Pinning, and an honest account of what it buys

Deep merge with override priority is the whole mechanism. A user who pins
`script` and `cwd` in their override is protected from those fields changing
underneath them; a user who writes no override follows upstream on every
deploy.

**`user` and `group` are pinned permanently and cannot be set by the committed
file at all.** Privilege is not a recommendation, and it is the one thing a
compromised build genuinely cannot escalate on its own.

**Pinning anything else is defence in depth, not a boundary.** If upstream is
compromised they already run arbitrary code in `bun install`'s postinstall or
in `make build`. They do not need the Flockfile. The two places pinning earns
its keep are the privilege carve-out above and persistence, since a changed
`script` survives forever while a build-time payload runs once. The real
boundary is which user the build runs as.

### What gets shared, and how

A fresh worktree contains nothing that git ignores, so it cannot run: ReactMap
needs `config/local.json`, `config/areas.json`, `server/src/configs/**` and a
generated masterfile, all ignored. Something must put them there.

**The rule:** whatever is ignored-and-present **in the user's checkout**, minus
`.shepignore`, gets symlinked from there into each new release.

- **Enumerate with `git status --ignored --porcelain`, never by parsing
  `.gitignore`.** Parsing gets negations (`!server/src/configs/.gitkeep`),
  anchored globs (`/docker-compose.yml`) and nested ignore files wrong. Git
  already answers this question correctly.
- **`.shepignore`, committed in the repo, subtracts from that set.** Same
  idiom as `.dockerignore`, narrower syntax than `.gitignore`: a bare name
  matches at any depth (`node_modules` excludes every nested
  `packages/*/node_modules` along with the top-level directory) and a
  pattern containing `/` is anchored to the checkout root. Wildcards (`*`,
  `?`, `[`) are refused outright rather than silently matching nothing -
  deliberate, not an oversight: every real `.shepignore` this design has
  needed is one bare directory name, and a refused pattern fails loudly at
  parse time instead of an operator's build output quietly staying shared
  forever because their glob never matched. Widening this to full glob
  syntax later costs nothing - a pattern refused today would simply start
  working. Its entries start empty in every release instead of being
  shared.

ReactMap's is one line, `dist`. Koji's is one line, `target`.

**Why build outputs must be subtracted.** Symlink `dist/` back to a single
shared copy and release B's `vite build` writes through the symlink, replacing
the assets release A is currently serving, mid-build. Rolling back to A then
gets B's `dist`. Blue/green and rollback both die on that one line. The
`.gitignore` list conflates config, caches and build outputs because git
ignores all three for the same reason; `.shepignore` is where that distinction
gets made, by the person who knows it.

Absent a `.shepignore`, everything ignored is shared, which is the
zero-configuration case.

**A user wanting fresh dependencies** adds `node_modules` to `.shepignore`.
Same file, same syntax they already know, no array to maintain.

## The deploy sequence

1. `git fetch` in `<root>/git`. Compare the tracked branch's remote head to the
   last deployed sha. No change, nothing happens.
2. `git worktree add releases/<sha> <sha>`. Shares the object store, so no
   re-download and no second `.git`.
3. Symlink the shared set (above) into the new worktree.
4. Run the build in the worktree, if the Flockfile declares one. Wait for it to
   exit. A non-zero exit aborts here: `current` never moves and the running app
   is untouched, because it lives in a different directory.
5. `rename(2)` `current` onto the new release.
6. `Reload` the sheep.
7. Verify (below). On failure, point `current` back at the previous release and
   reload again.
8. On success, prune worktrees beyond the retention count.

**Steps 1 through 4 never touch the running app.** That alone is a large
improvement over building in place.

### Blue/green comes free

shep's reload runs `SpawnNew → AwaitReady → DrainOld → ReapOld`. The
replacement is spawned and reaches readiness before the old instance drains, so
the old release serves throughout. `ProcStatus::Stopping` is documented as
reachable from exactly that one path.

For `ctm`, which runs `bun .` and compiles the client with vite's API at
startup, this means the compile happens **in the new instance while the old one
still serves**. Today that compile happens while the process is down. That is
the single biggest win available here and it needs no new machinery.

Zero downtime requires the app to bind with SO_REUSEPORT. Without it, `Reload`
degrades and the design falls back to `Restart`, with downtime equal to boot
time.

### Verify

`verify` is an enum on the target, not a boolean:

- **`probed`** (default): wait for the sheep to reach `Online`, which shep
  reports only once the readiness probe passes. Refuse to deploy a sheep with
  no probe configured, naming the missing probe.
- **`alive`**: wait N seconds and confirm the process is still running.

Rin's construction, and better than the `verify = false` it replaced: choosing
`alive` is a visible, deliberate downgrade that still checks something, rather
than an opt-out that silently checks nothing.

### Build environment and artifacts

Two fields on the Flockfile's build block, both driven by Koji:

- **`build.env`** — environment for the build. `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` pointed at a
  shared cache keeps Rust compilation warm across releases, which matters
  because a from-scratch Koji build per deploy is not acceptable.
- **`build.artifacts`** — paths copied out of the build environment into the
  release afterwards. With a shared `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` the binary lands outside
  the release, so `script = ./target/release/koji` needs it copied back for the
  script to resolve and for rollback to have a real artifact.

Node needs neither: bun, yarn and pnpm all keep global caches outside the repo,
so a fresh worktree install is mostly cache hits.

**Partially symlinking `target/` was considered and rejected.** Cargo owns that
directory's layout and a half-symlinked one invites confusing breakage.

## Bootstrap and first opt-in

The dog surveys the flock via `ListFlock` and reports, without deploying
anything. Discovery is read-only; deploying requires opt-in.

```
reactmap   needs setup     git checkout, declares a deploy block
koji       eligible        git checkout, nothing declares a deploy
legacy     not eligible    /opt/legacy is not a git repository
```

Opting in creates the tree, clones, links from the user's existing checkout,
builds the first release, and swaps `current`. Then the cutover: start a new
sheep pointing at `current`, wait for `Online`, stop and delete the old
registration.

**The first cutover specifically may have downtime.** The new instance cannot
bind the port while the old one holds it unless the app uses SO_REUSEPORT.
Every deploy after the first is zero-downtime; the first is not necessarily.

A sheep whose cwd is not a git checkout is reported as not eligible and left
entirely alone. Turning a directory into a checkout is the operator's decision,
not a dog's.

## Retention and teardown

Worktrees are removed after a **successful** deploy, keeping N releases
(default 5, configurable in the dog's own config).

Never removed: the current release, the previous release (it is the rollback
target), or any release a running instance still points at.

Removal is `git worktree remove --force` — a built tree is always dirty, so
plain `remove` always refuses — followed by `git worktree prune`.

## Security posture

**The build is the dangerous step.** It executes code from a repository, and
postinstall scripts are the most common supply-chain vector in the Node
ecosystem.

**Builds run as the target sheep's `user`, never as the shepherd's.** shep
already resolves `user`/`group` per app, so the machinery exists. A compromised
ReactMap build gets ReactMap's privileges and nothing more. This is the single
requirement in this section that is not optional.

Recommended beyond that, in increasing order of effort: a system user per app,
so a compromise in one cannot read another's config; running the shepherd as
root only so that it can drop privileges; or running the whole shepherd
unprivileged with a reverse proxy for ports below 1024.

**A dog holds full socket authority.** It can issue `Delete` as easily as
`Restart`. Nothing here changes that, and it is why the confinement work
recorded under `shep install` in [deferred.md](https://github.com/TurtIeSocks/shep/blob/main/docs/specs/deferred.md) matters
more once this exists.

**Private repositories inherit the build user's git auth.** If git cannot reach
it, the dog cannot. No credential handling of its own, deliberately.

## Removal, and what it restores

Rin's requirement, and the failure it prevents: an operator rehomes the dog,
goes back to `~/ReactMap` because that is where they think their app lives,
restarts the sheep, and cannot work out why nothing updates. That sheep's `cwd`
was never `~/ReactMap`; it was a path under `$SHEP_HOME` they have no reason to
know about.

So **removing the dog restores the sheep to how it ran before the dog took
over**: the `cwd` and `script` recorded in `deploy.toml` at opt-in, reapplied
with `Start`, then a restart. The app goes back to running from the user's own
checkout, which is the only place they will think to look.

Two cases the restore has to distinguish, both answered from `deploy.toml`:

- **The sheep pre-existed the dog.** Restore its recorded `cwd` and `script`.
- **The dog bootstrapped it and there is nothing to restore.** Leave it running
  from `current`, unchanged, and say so plainly on the way out. Deleting an app
  because a deploy tool was uninstalled would be much worse than leaving it.

Rin's condition for accepting that second case, and it is a requirement on the
hook rather than on the dog: **the hook's stdout must reach the operator**, so
the dog can say where the app actually is.

```
bpm still running from $SHEP_HOME/deploy/bpm/current
```

Without that, "left running, unchanged" is indistinguishable from "quietly
abandoned somewhere you will not think to look", which is the failure this
whole section exists to prevent.

The deploy tree is left on disk either way. It is not the dog's to delete, and
in the bootstrap case a running app is still pointing into it.

## Concurrency

A push landing mid-deploy aborts the in-flight deploy and starts again at the
newer commit — **but only before the swap**. Once `current` has moved, the
deploy finishes and verifies, and the newer commit deploys after. Tearing down
mid-cutover is how you end up with nothing running.

Rin's reasoning for aborting rather than queueing: the common case is a hotfix
chasing a bad deploy, and the superseded build was not wanted anyway.

## Prerequisites

Three shipped-CLI issues, found by Rin using v0.1.0, are prerequisites rather
than related work. All three are reproduced and are being fixed on
`fix/dog-cli-ergonomics`:

1. **`shep adopt` cannot take a binary name or a `~/` path.** Both fail with
   "no file exists at that path", so a dog installed with `cargo install`
   cannot be adopted by name.
2. **The dog's name is a required positional.** Sheep already take an optional
   `--name` defaulting from the filename; adopt should match, stripping a
   leading `shep-` the way cargo strips `cargo-`.
3. **`shep <dogname> [args]` does not run an adopted dog.** git and cargo both
   do this. It is how the operator drives this dog at all: `shep deploy koji`,
   `shep deploy --rollback bpm`.

Number 3 resolves a question this design would otherwise have to work around,
since dogs cannot add CLI verbs.

Two further prerequisites are changes to shep itself rather than to this dog,
both of which came out of Rin asking what rehoming does:

4. **`shep rehome` must stop deleting `[dog.<name>]`.** Today it removes the
   dog from `enabled_dogs` and `adopted_dogs` *and* deletes the dog's config
   table. Those settings are the operator's, not the dog's, and destroying them
   makes re-adopting the same dog a from-scratch reconfiguration. Rehome should
   forget the adoption and leave the settings. This changes documented,
   shipped behaviour: the help text currently draws the `disable`/`rehome`
   line at "forgets its configuration", and that wording has to move to
   "forgets the adoption".

5. **Dogs need an on-remove lifecycle hook.** shep must give a dog a chance to
   act before it is forgotten, which is what makes the restore above possible
   at all. The shape that fits what already exists: run the dog's binary with a
   documented argv and `SHEP_HOME` set, under a timeout, and proceed regardless
   of the outcome. That rides on the same second invocation mode prerequisite 3
   introduces, and a dog that does not implement the hook simply exits non-zero
   on an argument it does not recognise, exactly as `shep-log-rotate` does
   today. Failure must never block removal; an operator asking to remove
   something is entitled to have it removed.

   **The hook's stdout is operator-facing and must be plumbed accordingly**,
   which constrains it in three ways that are easy to get wrong:

   - **It is third-party text on its way to a terminal, so it goes through
     `terminal_safe::sanitise` first.** `dog_index.rs` already established this
     boundary for the community index; a dog's parting message is the same
     category, and an unsanitised one could clear the screen or imitate shep's
     own output during a command the operator is watching.
   - **Under `--format json` it belongs in the envelope as a field**, never
     interleaved as raw text. Interleaving would corrupt the JSON of a command
     scripts are entitled to parse.
   - **It rides the existing notice stream** rather than inventing a fourth
     output tier, so `--quiet` governs it the same way it governs everything
     else, and the JSON envelope carries it regardless.

## Documentation shep owes

All five prerequisites change what an operator types or sees, which makes them
a hard trigger under shep's own CLAUDE.md rule: the `web/` site is published
and a change to the operator surface is not finished until the site says so.
This work belongs to shep, not to this repository, and it is listed here
because nothing else records it.

**Regenerate the CLI reference.** It is produced from the real binary's
`--help`, so it never needs writing by hand, but it does need running:

```
cargo build --release
./web/scripts/generate-cli-reference.sh
```

A stale copy fails no build, which is exactly why it drifts. `git diff`
afterwards is the check.

**`smit` goes in README.md's lexicon table.** Usefully, that table is the
source: `web/src/data/docsLexicon.ts` parses it at build time and
`terminology.astro` renders it, so one edit updates the README and the site
together. `docs/terminology.md` is the canonical lexicon and needs the same
row, with `badge` recorded as the plain alias.

**`output.astro` hard-codes the flock table**, currently
`ID NAME STATUS PID RESTARTS EXIT CPU MEM UPTIME FOLD`, and states that "ID,
NAME and STATUS never drop". A SMIT column lands in that sample, and the same
page is where its position in the adaptive drop order has to be written down.
That is the same open question listed below; the docs are where answering it
becomes visible.

**`dogs.astro`** carries the dog contract and needs three additions: the
`shep <dogname> [args]` passthrough as a second invocation mode, the on-remove
hook, and `rehome`'s changed semantics now that it forgets the adoption rather
than the configuration.

**Grep before assuming.** `cli.astro`, `from-pm2.astro`, `community-dogs.astro`
and `terminology.astro` all mention `adopt` or `rehome` today, and the argument
order is changing under them. Prose pages are hand-written and no generator
touches them.

**Build and check, both.** `astro build` does not typecheck, so a page passing
a component a prop it does not have builds clean and renders wrong. `astro
check` catches it. Both, every time.

Separately, and this repository's own work rather than shep's: a README, and an
entry in shep's community dog index once this publishes. The `cargo` source
kind that entry needs was added to the index on 2026-08-26, so nothing blocks
it.

## Open questions

- **Poll interval default.** 30 seconds is adequate for a single host and needs
  no inbound port, no HMAC verification and no public exposure. Webhooks are
  deliberately deferred: Vercel needs them because it is multi-tenant at scale.
  Un-exposing a port after the fact is harder than adding one later.
- **The `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` artifact copy is specified but not proven.** It
  should be validated against Koji before the plan commits to it.
- **Whether a `.shepignore` shipped by upstream is itself a risk.** Adding
  `config/local.json` to it would stop a user's config being linked. Low
  severity, since the app would visibly fail to start, but unrecorded
  until now.
- **Smit rendering when the terminal is narrow.** `shep flock` already drops
  columns adaptively; where a smit sits in that priority order is undecided.

## Worked examples

**Koji.** `.shepignore` is `target`. Build is `make build` with
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` pointed at a shared cache and `target/release/koji` copied
back. `.env` is ignored-and-present, so it links automatically. Script is
`./target/release/koji`.

**ReactMap with a build script.** `.shepignore` is `dist`. Build is
`bun install && bun run build`. Config, areas, `server/src/configs/**` and the
masterfile all link automatically. Script is `bun run ./server/src/serve.ts`.
This replaces the current arrangement of a `bpm_client` entry whose script is
`yarn build` with `autorestart: false`, a `pm2 restart`, a hardcoded 30-second
sleep, and then a second restart. The dog waits for the build to exit instead
of sleeping, and a failed build never restarts anything.

**ReactMap without a build script.** No build block at all. `bun .` compiles
the client with vite's API at startup, and the readiness probe already covers
that: the sheep stays `Starting` until the server answers. The dog does not
need to know a compile happened.

The three scenarios differ only in the build block. That is the test of whether
this design is the right shape.
